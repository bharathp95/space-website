                        <span>Exoplanets</span> Scientists have found over 4,000 exoplanets since the first such world was confirmed orbiting a sunlike star in 1995, according to NASA's Exoplanet Exploration page(opens in new tab). More than half of these discoveries were made by NASA's Kepler space telescope, which launched in 2009 on a mission to determine how common Earth-like planets are throughout the Milky Way galaxy.

                        Discovering the first true "alien Earth" is a long-held dream of astronomers â€” and recent exoplanet discoveries have shown that small, rocky worlds like our own are abundant in the galaxy. 
                      
                        To qualify as potentially life-friendly, a planet must be relatively small (and therefore rocky) and orbit in the "habitable zone" of its star, which is loosely defined as a location where water can exist in liquid form on a world's surface. When telescope technology improves, other factors will be considered as well, such as the planet's atmospheric composition and how active its parent star is.

                    <p>This exoplanet, which lies just 22 light-years from Earth, is at least 4.5 times as massive as Earth, according to NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory(opens in new tab). Gliese 667Cc completes one orbit around its host star in a mere 28 days, but that star is a red dwarf considerably cooler than the sun.</p>

                    <p>Kepler-69c, which is about 2,700 light-years away, is about 70 percent larger than Earth. So, once again, researchers are unsure about its composition.

                        The planet completes one orbit every 242 days, making its position within its solar system comparable to that of Venus within ours.</p>

                    <p>This planet is at most 10 percent larger than Earth, and it also appears to reside in the habitable zone of its star, though on the zone's outer edge; Kepler-186f receives just one-third of the energy from its star that Earth gets from the sun.

                    <p>Orbiting the star TRAPPIST-1 are the most Earth-sized planets ever discovered in the habitable zone of a single star. This planetary system is made up of seven worlds.
