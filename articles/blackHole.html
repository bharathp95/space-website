                    <p>
                        Rather, it is a great amount of matter packed into a very small area - think of a star ten times
                        more massive than the Sun squeezed into a sphere approximately the diameter of a city.

                    <p>
                        <span>Black holes</span> are regions of spacetime exhibiting such strong gravitational effects
                        that nothing—not even particles and electromagnetic radiation such as light—can escape from
                        inside it. The theory of general relativity predicts that a sufficiently compact mass can deform
                        spacetime to form a black hole.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The boundary of the region from which no escape is possible is called the event horizon.
                        Although the event horizon has an enormous effect on the fate and circumstances of an object
                        crossing it, no locally detectable features appear to be observed. In many ways, a black hole
                        acts like an ideal black body, as it reflects no light. Moreover, quantum field theory in curved
                        spacetime predicts that event horizons emit Hawking radiation, with the same spectrum as a black
                        body of a temperature inversely proportional to its mass. This temperature is on the order of
                        billionths of a kelvin for black holes of stellar mass, making it essentially impossible to
                        observe.
