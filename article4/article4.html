                        <p>The Milky Way is the galaxy that includes our Solar System, with the name describing the galaxy's appearance from Earth: a hazy band of light seen in the night sky formed from stars that cannot be individually distinguished by the naked eye. 
                            The Milky Way is a barred spiral galaxy with an estimated D25 isophotal diameter of 26.8 ± 1.1 kiloparsecs (87,400 ± 3,590 light-years),[8] but only about 1,000 light years thick at the spiral arms (more at the bulge).

                    <h2>Milky-Way: An Overview</h2>
                    <p>The Milky Way has several satellite galaxies and is part of the Local Group of galaxies, which form part of the Virgo Supercluster, which is itself a component of the Laniakea Supercluster

                        It is estimated to contain 100-400 billion stars and at least that number of planets. The Solar System is located at a radius of about 27,000 light-years (8.3 kpc) from the Galactic Center,[31] on the inner edge of the Orion Arm, one of the spiral-shaped concentrations of gas and dust. The stars in the innermost 10,000 light-years form a bulge and one or more bars that radiate from the bulge. The Galactic Center is an intense radio source known as Sagittarius A*, a supermassive black hole of 4.100 (± 0.034) million solar masses. Stars and gases at a wide range of distances from the Galactic Center orbit at approximately 220 kilometers per second. The constant rotational speed appears to contradict the laws of Keplerian dynamics and suggests that much (about 90%) of the mass of the Milky Way is invisible to telescopes, neither emitting nor absorbing electromagnetic radiation. This conjectural mass has been termed "dark matter". The rotational period is about 212 million years at the radius of the Sun.

                    <p>The Milky Way is visible as a hazy band of white light, some 30° wide, arching the night sky.[53] Although all the individual naked-eye stars in the entire sky are part of the Milky Way Galaxy, the term "Milky Way" is limited to this band of light.[54][55] The light originates from the accumulation of unresolved stars and other material located in the direction of the galactic plane. Brighter regions around the band appear as soft visual patches known as star clouds. The most conspicuous of these is the Large Sagittarius Star Cloud, a portion of the central bulge of the galaxy.[56] Dark regions within the band, such as the Great Rift and the Coalsack, are areas where interstellar dust blocks light from distant stars. Peoples of the southern hemisphere, including the Inca and Australian aborigines, identified these regions as dark cloud constellations.[57] The area of sky that the Milky Way obscures is called the Zone of Avoidance.[58].</p>

                    <p>The concept of space is considered to be of fundamental importance to an understanding of the
                        physical universe. However, disagreement continues between philosophers over whether it is
                        itself an entity, a relationship between entities, or part of a conceptual framework.</p>

                    <h2>Major Milestones..</h2>
                    <p>The first artificial Earth satellite, Sputnik 1, was launched by the Soviet Union on October 4,
                        1957. The first human to go into space, Yuri Gagarin, was launched, again by the Soviet Union,
                        for a one-orbit journey around Earth on April 12, 1961. Within 10 years of that first human
                        flight, American astronauts walked on the surface of the Moon. Apollo 11 crew members Neil
                        Armstrong and Edwin (“Buzz”) Aldrin made the first lunar landing on July 20, 1969. The first
                        space shuttle, Columbia, was launched on April 12, 1981.</p>

                    <p>The galactic plane is inclined by about 60° to the ecliptic (the plane of Earth's orbit). Relative to the celestial equator, it passes as far north as the constellation of Cassiopeia and as far south as the constellation of Crux, indicating the high inclination of Earth's equatorial plane and the plane of the ecliptic, relative to the galactic plane.</p>

Because of this high inclination, depending on the time of night and year, the Milky Way arch may appear relatively low or relatively high in the sky. For observers from latitudes approximately 65° north to 65° south.</p>
