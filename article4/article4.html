                    <h2>Space Exploration: An Overview</h2>
                    <p>We refer to the expanding universe with one simple word: space. But do we know what space is?
                        Space is a continuous area or expanse which is free, available and unoccupied. It is a boundless
                        three-dimensional extent in which objects and events have relative position and direction. It is
                        the zone above and around our planet where there is no air to breathe or light to scatter. It is
                        a vacuum devoid of matter where sound can not travel. The earth looks round only when seen from
                        space. One can only see land and water. In space there is no gravity due to which things float
                        in the air.
                        Space travel began in 1957 with the launch of the first satellite, called Sputnik, by the former
                        Soviet Union. Many satellites and probes are launched into space. This is done to observe the
                        Earth, collect data on climate and weather, supply modern navigation systems, explore distant
                        celestial bodies and to perform scientific research related to space. Yuri Gagarin became the
                        first human being to fly to space on 12th April 1961.</p>

                    <p>The concept of space is considered to be of fundamental importance to an understanding of the
                        physical universe. However, disagreement continues between philosophers over whether it is
                        itself an entity, a relationship between entities, or part of a conceptual framework.</p>

                    <h2>Major Milestones..</h2>
                    <p>The first artificial Earth satellite, Sputnik 1, was launched by the Soviet Union on October 4,
                        1957. The first human to go into space, Yuri Gagarin, was launched, again by the Soviet Union,
                        for a one-orbit journey around Earth on April 12, 1961. Within 10 years of that first human
                        flight, American astronauts walked on the surface of the Moon. Apollo 11 crew members Neil
                        Armstrong and Edwin (“Buzz”) Aldrin made the first lunar landing on July 20, 1969. The first
                        space shuttle, Columbia, was launched on April 12, 1981.</p>

                        <h2>Comet</h2>
                        <p>
                            A comet is an icy, small Solar System body that, when passing close to the Sun, warms and
                            begins to release gases, a process that is called outgassing. This produces a visible
                            atmosphere or coma, and sometimes also a tail. These phenomena are due to the effects of
                            solar radiation and the solar wind acting upon the nucleus of the comet. Comet nuclei range
                            from a few hundred meters to tens of kilometers across and are composed of loose collections
                            of ice, dust, and small rocky particles.
